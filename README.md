# Composition 


## Reading

* Kearns Ch. 4.

The system that you are required to use in the assignment is the one that is
described from 4.6 onwards. We will diverge from Kearns in our treatment of the
iota function. Where she uses `Ix(P(x))`, we will simply use `I(P)` and we will
not try to assign this to a constant. The meaning of `the dog` will be `I(Dog)`
in our system.

## Our notation

We extend our notation as: 

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `A`    | universal quantifier |
| `E`    | existential quantifier |
| `~`    | negation |
| `&`    | conjunction |
| `V`    | disjunction |
| `>`    | conditional |
| `=`    | equality|
| `\x`   | lambda abstraction |
| `I`    | iota function |


## Task

* Edit the file `questions.md` to answer the assignment questions.
