Questions on basics of composition 
----------------------------------

Derive the meaning of the following expressions. You are not required to draw
the trees for derivations. List the interpretation of items by numbering them,
then list the function application steps. Base your solution on Kearns' Ch. 4,
Section 4.6 onwards. The first question is answered for you as an example.

1. Jack is nice. 
    ```
    Answer:
    1. |Jack| = j
    2. |nice| = \x[Nice(x)]
    3. |is| = \P[P]

    3(2) = 4 =  \x[Nice(x)]    
    4(1) =  Nice(j)
